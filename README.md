# OIBSIP_Python_Task4 – Weather Application (SkyCast)

## 📌 Objective
To develop a Python-based Weather Application that provides real-time weather information using a user-friendly graphical interface. The application allows users to select a city and view current weather conditions along with a short-term forecast.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Tkinter (GUI development)  
- OpenWeatherMap API  
- Requests library  
- Geocoder (for auto-detecting location)  
- PIL (Image Processing for UI enhancement)  

## ⚙️ Features Implemented
- Fullscreen graphical user interface
- City selection using dropdown list
- Auto-detect current location feature
- Real-time weather data retrieval
- Display of:
  - Temperature
  - Weather condition and description
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - Feels-like temperature
  - Atmospheric pressure
- 5-day weather forecast
- Input validation and error handling
- Clean and modern UI design

## 🧩 Steps Performed
1. Designed a responsive GUI using Tkinter.
2. Integrated OpenWeatherMap API for live weather data.
3. Implemented city selection via dropdown menu.
4. Added automatic location detection using IP-based geolocation.
5. Processed and displayed weather metrics clearly.
6. Enhanced the interface with gradient backgrounds and icons.
7. Tested the application with multiple cities.

## 🌡 Weather API Used
OpenWeatherMap API is used to fetch real-time and forecast weather data in metric units.

## ✅ Outcome
A fully functional Weather Application that provides accurate and real-time weather updates through an intuitive and visually appealing interface.
- Data handling and visualization
- Improving user experience through UI design
